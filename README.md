The team members where allocated sections of the assignment that reflected their corresponding skill sets. This was to enhance the overall successfulness of the project. 
The open and consistent communication within the group was done via Discord on a weekly basis. All documentation sharing and group editing was conducted using Microsoft Teams. The GitHub website has continued from the previous project of assignment 2, to which you can follow the link above to view the Team website. 
The GitHub repository will not reflect the contribution of each member, however the group has agreed that over the course of the project there has been equal participation from each member. During the early stages of the project James was a very prominent contributor, along with Steve and later in the project was the equivalent input from Marty and Karla. 
The positive dynamics of the team has been clearly represented in the quality and consistency of work that has been produced over the semester and especially during this current project.

##Group History 
The Dynamos have a remarkable group dynamic with team members willing to collaborate and volunteer for tasks. In the beginning, the team was concerned about the fact the members are situated in different locations across Australia. This issue was dissolved quickly with the team demonstrating fantastic communication skills via the utilisation of online tools such as Discord, GitHub and Microsoft Teams.
The current project has seen the implementation of a more organised task allocation process. Continuing on from the last project, the team was able to monitor progress, stay on track and assist each other. This resulted in the production of a presentable and professional report for assignment 2. The weekly team meetings, overall work ethics and the group’s variety of skill sets are some of the contributing aspects that has created a successful group.

#MARTY – MY HEALTH HELPER
[Facebook:](https://www.facebook.com/Marty-My-Health-Helper-453375565413556/?modal=admin_todo_tour)

##Project Overview 
###Proposed Idea: 
This project involves the creation of a multi-platform application that will serve the Health Care sector. The objectives of this project are to develop an essential tool that will facilitate the organisation of medical services, medications and appointments while enhancing communication across the sector. In addition, the indispensable element of this application is the capacity to implement paperless scripts and an advanced medication monitoring system. 
The ‘Marty – My Health Helper’ is aiming to be a total community health integration system that will inform the user of appointments, while assisting in the monitoring of treatments, medications, emotional wellbeing and recovery progression. The end goal for this project is to develop an application that will simplify the process of ongoing healthcare treatments & the processes behind the prescription of medication in Australia.

##Aims:
The objectives of this project are to develop an essential tool that will facilitate the organisation of medical services, medications and appointments while enhancing communication across the sector. The indispensable purpose of this application is to be a total community health integration system that will inform the user of appointments, while assisting in the monitoring of treatments, medications, emotional wellbeing and recovery progression systems. 
The ‘Marty - Health Helper’ is committed to becoming the first paperless script application in Australia. This includes the implementation of features such as a nationally united and technologically advanced medication monitoring system.

## Psychometrics Report Findings:
##### by James Phelan

The test outcomes for all members of RMIT Dynamos vary, 
providing multiple different ways of performing in groups and achieving common goals. 
There are a few traits shared by different team members but overall there is quite a variety of personality traits, learning styles and other approaches to working in groups. 
The diversity within RMIT Dynamos should work well in achieving the tasks set out before us. by James Phelan

## Ideal Jobs:
#### Updated Assignment3:
##### by James Phelan & Karla McLachlan



· James: Business Analyst (Planning, data analysis, communication, financial modelling) 
The data that has been presented from Burning Glass regarding my ideal career as a Business Analyst has not altered my goals for the future. My studies will continue as planned, working towards a Bachelor of Business, then pursuing an entry level position into a related business field. After gaining relevant work experience, study experience and combining my current strengths and skills, I believe following my career path and achieving my goals is a very realistic prospect.

· Steve: Technology Services Manager (Experience working with a range of software, hardware and networking. Good communication. Proficient in MS Applications. Quick learner. Flexible) 
Introduction to Information Technology has made it clear the expected skill set is highly valued with future employers. Along with the encouragement from my group dynamics, my journey into updating qualifications will be rewarding to further suitability as a Technology Services manager. I will be continuing skill development and life experience, which will greatly enhance career prospects. My desire to gain qualifications for future Missionary Service in the IT Services Manager area has been greatly enhanced.  

· Karla: Data Analyst (Planning capability. Understanding data flow & gathering. Communication with stakeholders. Producing hypothesis with data for business progression.) 
The experience gained from this semester has amplified my desire to complete my degree and start my ideal job as an IT Data Analyst. However, the assignment 2 tasks have allowed me to review the path in which I can obtain my degree. This has led to a transfer into a different degree that will allow me to gain the career path as an IT Data Analyst. 

· Marty: Software Developer/Programmer (Experience in multiple programming languages)
During the last assignment I was informed of the limited number of job adverts for my ideal career.  I have not been discouraged to accomplish my goal of becoming a software/program developer. Following the conclusion of Introduction to Information Technology and being exposed to different personalities, I know this experience will allow me to tailor my work and explanations to different individuals. This will give me an advantage, in what has previously been reported in a very competitive and limited opportunity position. 

##Summary of Ideal Jobs 

The members of the group have not changed ideal careers. The participation of Introduction to IT has only encouraged and enforced the overall determination. The overall conclusion is that each member is furthermore strong-willed and striving towards the career path that each member was originally set on. 
James and Karla are both more focused on analyst roles, leaning towards the business side of a company. Analysing companies to improve efficiency and productivity are both traits shared by Business Analysts and Data Analysts. 
Steve and Marty are both more focused on technical IT roles, with Steve leaning towards the management of technology that has already been implemented, while Marty in a developer role would provide implementation of new technical software.
Even though there are shared traits between team members, each person’s career path is different and provides an insight into where one degree can lead to so many different paths.
