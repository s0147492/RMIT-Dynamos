The test outcomes for all members of RMIT Dynamos vary, 
providing multiple different ways of performing in groups and achieving common goals. 
There are a few traits shared by different team members but overall there is quite 
a variety of personality traits, learning styles and other approaches to working in groups. 
The diversity within RMIT Dynamos should work well in achieving the tasks set out before us.
